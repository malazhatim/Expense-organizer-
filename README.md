Project Overview:

We propose to build an intuitive and efficient Expense Tracker Web Application using a straightforward, yet robust tech stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, PHP for the backend, and MySQL  for database management. The application will allow users to manage their personal finances by adding, viewing, and analysing income and expenses. Additionally, it will feature a graphical representation of financial data to provide an at-a-glance summary of financial health.


Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: PHP

Database: MySQL

Key Features & Implementation:

Add Income and Expenses:

Frontend: Users will interact with a simple and user-friendly form designed with HTML and styled using CSS to input their income and expenses.
Backend (PHP): A PHP script will handle form submissions, validate the input, and securely insert the data into a MySQL database.

Database Schema:

The transactions table will record each entry, categorising it as income or expense along with details such as amount, description, and date.
View a Summary of Total Income/Expenses
Frontend: The data will be presented in a clean and organised format using HTML tables or card layouts, allowing users to see an overview of their financial transactions.
Backend (PHP): PHP scripts will query the database, calculating the total income, expenses, and displaying the balance.
Users will be able to filter the data based on time periods (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
